# Calculate the edges of a mesh and add them as properties (deals with partially computed normals)
"""
    update_edges!(m::Mesh{FT}) where {FT<:AbstractFloat}

Calculate the edges of a mesh and add them as properties. 
This function checks if the edges property exists, and if not, it creates it. 
It then computes the edges for all vertices in the mesh.

# Arguments
- `m`: The mesh for which to update the edges.

# Returns
Nothing. It modifies the mesh in place by adding the edges as a property.

# Example
```jldoctest
julia> vs = [Vec(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), Vec(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), Vec(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)];

julia> m = Mesh(vs);

julia> update_edges!(m);

julia> edges(m);
```

# Create the three edges stored as a vector of vectors
"""
    push_edges!(vs, m, i0)

Create the three edges stored as a vector of vectors from 
the vertices `vs` starting at index `i0` and add them to the
mesh's property.

# Arguments
- `vs`: The vertices of the mesh.
- `m`: The mesh to which the edges will be added.
- `i0`: The starting index in the vertices vector from which to create the edges.

# Returns
Nothing. It modifies the mesh in place by adding the edges.

# Example
```jldoctest
